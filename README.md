# Horizons Web Lite-version
Functionality

The functionality of the Horizons Platform is a very simple application.
# Users

Guests can Register, Login and view the Home Page, Index Page and Details Page. 
Logged-in users can publish destinations and edit destinations they have created. 
Users (guest-users + logged-in-users) can view all published destinations, including those by other users, on the Home Page (/Destination/Index). 
If the user is the publisher of the destination
•	They can't see the [Favorites] button
•	They can see the [Details] button
If the user is not the publisher of the destination, they can add the destination to their collection [Favorites].
# Destination

Destinations can be added by logged-in-users. All added destinations are visualized on the Home Page (/Destination/Index) with some of their associated information. 
Destinations are visualized on the Index Page (/Destinations/Index) with one or two buttons:
•	If the user IS NOT the publisher of the destination – [Details][Favorites]
•	If the user IS the publisher of the destination – [Details]
The [Favorites] button adds the destination to the user's collection of favorite destinations (Favorites) unless it is already added.
The [Details] button displays a new page with the full information for the selected destination. The actions and buttons displayed on this page will vary depending on the user's identity and role:
•	Guest (Not Logged In):
The user can see the full details of the destination but will not be able to add to favorites, edit, or delete the destination. No action buttons ([Favorites], [Edit], [Delete]) will be shown.
•	Logged-in User (Not the Publisher):
The user will see the full details of the destination and will have access to the [Favorites] button, allowing them to add the destination to their collection of favorite destinations (if it has not already been added). The [Edit] and [Delete] buttons will not be displayed as they are not the publisher of the destination.
•	Publisher of the Destination:
The publisher will have full access to the destination's details and will be able to see both the [Edit] and [Delete] buttons. However, the [Favorites] button will not be displayed since the publisher cannot add their own destination.
The [Edit] button displays a new page with a form, filled in with all of the info for the selected destination. Users can change this info and save it.

Users have a Favorites page where only the destinations they have selected as favorites are displayed.
•	The [Remove] button removes the selected destination from the user's collection of favorite destinations.
